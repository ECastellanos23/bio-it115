Hello, my name is Enrique Castellanos, I am a very outgoing person who enjoys getting to know people whoever I cross paths with. Caring and compassionate are traits that resemble me, and I find myself always helping others more than I help myself. My hobbies are sports and bodybuilding which takes a lot of self-discipline, I also train others by helping them succeed in areas they struggle with, and I Iove to push people to reach their goals whether strength training or building muscle. I am very adventurous and love the outdoors, I enjoy quality time with my family. On my day-to-day life I like to study the bible and learn about apologist, I like to have conversations and debates and love observing and taking notes.
